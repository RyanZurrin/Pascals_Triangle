# Pascals_Triangle

Blaise Pascal (1623 – 1662) gave his name to Pascal’s Triangle long before Nicholas Wirth decided to name a computer programming language in his honor. 

Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of numbers composed of the coefficients in the expansion of (x + y)n for n=0, 1, 2, 3 etc.  The “triangle extends downward indefinatly,
the coefficients of the expansion (x + y)n being in the (n + 1) row.  As shown below the array is bordered by 1’s.  Otherwise, the sum of two adjacent numbers in one row 
is equal to the number in the next row between the two numbers.  The array is symmetric about the vertical line through the “vertex”.
